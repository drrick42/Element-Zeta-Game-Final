Welcome to our facility. Here we will test you on
merits of logic and problem solving.
&&Stop for a moment as I inform you on a few things 
to know about what you will observe here:
&&The beam above you is known as Element Zeta.
Diffusing Element Zeta into light allows us interact 
with Light Solid and Dark Solid material.
&&Sections of the floor are made out Dark Solid and
Light Solid material, respectively.
&&After you have made proper observations of Element
Zeta and its effects on the materials, progress
forward.
