This is The Chasm.
&&
&&Unfortunately, the game's brief narrative story 
has no resolution in the demo copy of Element Zeta.
&&We hope you enjoyed the gameplay.
&&We hope the narrative complemented the puzzles.
&&The Chasm is the final level of the game.
&&But it doesn't have to be the end.
&&
&&This project may be further developed.
&&Or it may be abandoned.
&&
&&Either way, your participation has been 
appreciated.

&&"Well, at least this can go on a GitHub repo and
make it look like I sort of know what I'm doing."
-Derrick Dent
&&"I think I need arrays."
-Gwen Stevens
&&"Now that the game's almost done, let's scrap it and
make a Farmville clone."
